Turnip the heat, it's cold in here!
I didn't know you could yodel!
Bless you!
Is there an owl in here?
Is there an echo in here?
Pencil fall down if you don't wear a belt!
Cereal pleasure to meet you.
Orange you going to answer the door?
A little girl who can't reach the doorbell!
I didn't sneeze!
Figs the doorbell, it's broken.
Banana split so ice creamed!
I'm fine, Hawaii you?
Harry up and answer the door!
I butter not tell you!
No bell so I'll knock.
I scream tastes cool on a hot day.
Robin the piggy bank again.
Abby birthday to you!
Adore is between us. Open up!
