C++ project, written based on UML diagram.

The system monitors four different signals of an airplane.

Four sensor classes are  derived from a common abstract class by specifying sensor types.

Four signal classes are derived from an abstract class by specifying specific functions for generating signals.

Signals are generated by specifying arguments and calling the signal function.
